# The Curious Case of the Measles: The Physical and Digital Spread in the United States 

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared measles eliminated in 
the United States in 2000. Recently, however, various outbreaks now 
threaten that status. Our project uses data from the Center for Disease 
Control (CDC), Google, and Twitter to explore whether trends in the 
digital frenzy around measles correspond with actual cases.
